### Course Description: 
This introductory course is intended to provide the mathematical foundations needed for students interested in AI, machine learning, and other related fields. 
Upon completion of the course, students are expected to have acquired the mathematical background needed to enroll in graduate-level courses such as CSE 802, 
CSE 881, CSE 847, and CSE 849. The course will cover fundamental topics in linear algebra, probability and statistics, and optimization, as well 
as some basic concepts in learning from data. The course assumes students already have some experience programming in python.

There is no textbook for the class. The materials for the lecture will be adapted from the following recommended books: 
- C.C. Aggarwal, "Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning: A Textbook". Springer (2020). 
- S. Banerjee and A. Roy. “Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics”, CRC Press (2014).
- S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares", Cambridge University Press (2018). A draft of the book is available [here](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/).
- A. Blum, J. Hopcroft, and R. Kannan. “Foundations of Data Science”, Cambridge University Press (2020). A draft of the book is available [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf).

### Instructional Objectives:
The primary learning objectives of this course are:
- To provide students with the mathematical background needed in AI, machine learning, and other related fields.
- To enable students to have hands-on experience writing programs for manipulating/analyzing data based on the concepts learned in class.  

You will meet the objectives listed above through a combination of the following activities in this course: 
- Attend and participate in the discussion during lecture.
- Complete the quizzes, homework assignments, exam, and project.

### Course Policies:

- **Vaccination:** All students must adhere to the university policy regarding vaccination. In the case of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, it may be required to temporarily change the instructional modality for this course. Students should be prepared to complete the course work as dictated by the circumstances of the state and university policies.
- **Attendance:** Students are expected to attend all the lectures and must inform the instructor if they are unable to do so due to emergency or other legitimate reasons (e.g., quarantine due to having symptoms of Covid-19).
- **Online Quizzes:** Online quizzes will be available on D2L and must be completed before midnight on Friday of the assigned week (unless specified otherwise). **No extension will be given.** You are allowed up to 3 attempts per quiz (only the highest grade for each quiz will be recorded). Only the top-10 highest quiz scores will be counted toward your final grade.
- **Assignment and Late Submission Policy:** Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise.  You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- **Exam Information:** There will be 1 midterm exam and no final exam. Exam will be open book and notes. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to conference travel, documented illness, or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, at least a week before the scheduled exam. 
- **Discussion Forum:** We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2022/cse840/home) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post them on Piazza. Do not post your solution or attempted solution (e.g., for assignments or project) on Piazza. You are prohibited from  posting the course materials (including slides, quizzes, homework assignments, exam, and their solutions) on any other websites without permission from the instructor. You are also prohibited from soliciting help by posting quiz and homework questions online on websites such as Chegg, Brainly, Quizlet, and other similar websites. Violation of the policy will result in an Academic Dishonesty Report (ADR) filed and a zero grade for the entire quiz or assignment. The ADR for students who continue to post questions from assignments or quizzes to these sites will lead to additional sanctions, including an automatic failing grade of zero (0.0) for the course. 
- **Study Groups:** You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your quizzes, homework assignments, and programming project with other students.  This includes sharing your solution with another student to double-check answers, which is considered cheating. All submitted assignments (quizzes, homeworks, project, and exam) must be your own work.**Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the entire assignment.* In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
- **Resources for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD):** Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (“VISA”) form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (exam, homework, project, etc). To make an appointment with a specialist, contact:  (517) 353-9642 or TTY:  (517) 355-1293. The website for RCPD is located at [http://MYProfile.rcpd.msu.edu](http://MYProfile.rcpd.msu.edu).
- **Academic Honesty:** All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system provided by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and College of Engineering. The Department of Computer Science adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life; Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 on the assignment/exam/project/quiz.  
- **Religious Observance:** Michigan State University has long had a policy to permit students, faculty/academic staff, and support staff to observe those holidays set aside by their chosen religious faith If you wish to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday, make arrangements in advance with the instructor.
- **Tolerance and Civility:** MSU strives to build an academic community with living and learning environments that expects tolerance of viewpoints and civility toward others, whether at public forums, athletic events, in residential communities, classrooms or laboratories. We call upon all who participate in university events to promote tolerance and civil behavior and to hold themselves to high standards that reflect the university’s commitment to respect viewpoints that may be different from their own. Only by respecting individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas can we build an environment of civility that is conducive to advancing knowledge and transforming lives.
